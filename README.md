## Greetings
My name is Aaron and I'm a human who lives in Portland, Oregon.

#### âš¡ Things you might like to know about me
- Currently identify myself professionally as "software engineer" because ambiguity is hard to convey and "person who wears many hats" doesn't work as well
- Have an education background as a research psychologist focusing on cognition and psychometrics
- Have a family (wife + kids) who are way more important to me than most definitions of "success"
- Grew up in small towns in coastal Oregon and rural California
- Worked as a research data scientist from 2009-2013 on projects at the Department of Defense
- Care very deeply about ethical issues surrounding technology especially things like privacy, equity and social good

#### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to...
- Bake a perfect apple pie
- Make things with wood that are nice and pleasing
- Write more effectively
- Streamline software delivery on small teams
- Compute interesting problems on the edge
- Model event flows more robustly
- Design systems oriented microservices
- Develop low-code/no-code products
- Maintain privacy through encryption and security

I currently work at a company called [Bumped](https://bumped.com) and work on my own endeavors one day a week.
